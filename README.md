# Space Invader (a recreation by Hang Pham)

The following project provides a recreation of the popular game Space Invader, with some novel functionalities. This was one of Hang's many Java projects during her studies in high school, where she redeveloped games which played a huge role in her childhood. 

## Installation
Use a Java Integrated Development Environment, such as Eclipse, to run the code. Every file but the README.md file is required for the game to function. 


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, but please credit. As this project was developed with a relatively intermediate knowledge of programing (based on knowledge taught from school), the code might not be the most optimal. 
Also, note that game has only been tested on Windows OS, not MAC OS. I sincerely apologize.
